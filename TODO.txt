BUGS
----
o Some invalid DXF data gets pass the import checks and breaks the tessing code
o Broken polyhedron() entities are not correctly detected and cause CGAL segfaults
o Tesselation via GLU sometimes produces strange results
o Non-manifold objects make CGAL crash (e.g. two cubes which touch at one edge)
o Export STL: Exports existing CGAL model even though the current model is changed, but not CGAL rendered

USER INTERFACE
--------------
o Preferences
  - background colors
  - colors
    - OpenCSG: face back/front, edges?
    - CGAL: face back/front, edge back/front, vertex back/front
  - wireframe width
  - pointsize
  - OpenGL params
  - Default language feature settings
  - Auto-view CSG/thrown together on load
  - editor font
o Export etc.: automatically add missing extension as in SaveAs
o Mac OS X:
  - embed examples into bundle -> separate example menu?
  - Use examples as default File Open folder
  - distribute as (self-unpacking?) dmg containing a single .app instead of zip
  - universal binary -> fix cgal and opencsg
o MDI
  - Think about how to do MDI the right way
  - Quit vs. Close MainWindow.
    Today Quit just closes the current window and there is no close function
o 3D View
  - Improve mouse rotation
  - Add modifier key combos to handle pan on 1 mouse button systems
  - Show grid
  - 4 x split view w/orthogonal cameras?
  - Quick highlighting of object under the cursor in the editor
o Editor
  - Autocompletion/hints for builtin (and user-defined) functions/modules
  - builtin quick function reference/help
  - More infrastructur for external editor (or is the reload good enough?)
  - Evaluate QCodeEdit (http://qcodeedit.edyuk.org)
o Misc
  - Fix current_win hack
  - Reload and compile: Ask for confirmation if file is locally edited
    (make this configurable in preferences?)
  - Save: Ask for confirmation if file has been externaly changed

ENGINE
------
o 2D Subsystem
  - Add generic 3D->2D projection statements
o Advanced Transformations
  - Add statement for 2D and 3D minkowski sum
  - Add statement for refinement via surface subdivision
  - Add statement for intersections in cartesian product of childs
o Function-Module-Interface
  - Pass a module instanciation to a function (e.g. for a volume() function)
  - Pass a function to a module instanciation (e.g. for dynamic extrusion paths)
o Language Frontend
  - Allow local variables and functions everywhere (not only on module level)
o DXF Import
  - Support for POLYLINE entity
  - Support for SPLINE entity
  - Support for Aligned, Radius, Diameter and Ordinate DIMENSION
  - Support for LEADER entity
  - Test INSERT with rotation. code looks wrong
  - idea: DXF inline - convert from dxf to OpenSCAD syntax -> parametrize dxf content
o Mesh optimization on STL export
  - Remove super small triangles (all sides are short)
  - Replace super thin triangles (one h is short)
o Misc
  - Add symbolic colors to the color() statement
  - Go through default values of parameters (e.g. cube() has x,y,z=1 while linear_extrude() has height=100)
o Grammar
  - dim->name -> dim->label
  - A random(seed) function

CODE
----

o Refactor from MainWindow:
  - CSG data structure (compiled model)
  - CGAL data structure (compiled model)
o C++-ify
  - Use smart pointers where it makes sense (e.g. instead of homegrown refcount,
    and to get memory ownership under control)
  - Use static_cast instead of C-style casts

INFRASTRUCTURE
--------------
o Think about making external libraries easier available. Probably mostly convenience.
o Use a logging framework to get debugging/info output more under control?
  (check log4j, google project)

MISC
----
o Collect "all" available OpenSCAD scripts from the internets and batch convert them
  to STL to assist with robustness testing.
