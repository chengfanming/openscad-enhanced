TODO
----
o Preferences
  - background colors
  - Model outside/inside color
  - wireframe color and width
  - OpenGL params
  - Default language feature settings
o External editor
o Hide/show editor
o hide/show log widget
o Mac OS X:
  - embed examples into bundle -> separate example menu?
  - Use examples as default File Open folder
  - distribute as (self-unpacking?) dmg containing a single .app instead of zip
  - universal binary -> fix cgal and opencsg
o Build multiple variants from one single build? (e.g. without opencsg)
o MDI
  - Think about how to do MDI the right way
  - Quit vs. Close MainWindow.
    Today Quit just closes the current window and there is no close function
  - windowModified property -> windowtitle and check on quit/close
o 3D interaction
  - Improve mouse rotation
  - Add modifier key combos to handle pan on 1 mouse button systems
